On a miss, you can ask a question anyway but that will mean you were personally complicit in creating the situation you are now dealing with. The questions are:\n* When I dealt with this creature (or one of its kind), what did I learn?\n* What black magic do I know that could help here?\n* Do I know anyone who might be behind this?\n* Who do I know who can help us right now?"
