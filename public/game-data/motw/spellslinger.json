They've heard of you and respect your power. With affected humans, take +1 forward when you **manipulate** them. You may **manipulate** affected monsters as if they were human, with no bonus.",
				"**Could've Been Worse:** When you miss a **use magic** roll you can choose one of the following options instead of losing control of the magic:\n* **Fizzle:** The preparations and materials for the spell are ruined. You'll have to start over from scratch with the prep time doubled.\n* **This Is Gonna Suck:** The effect happens, but you trigger all of the listed glitches but one. You pick the one you avoid.",
				"**Enchanted Clothing:** Pick an article of every-day clothing–it's enchanted without any change in appearance. Take -1 harm from any source that tries to get at you through the garment.",
				"**Forensic Divination:** When you successfully **investigate a mystery**, you may ask \"What magic was done here?\" as a free extra question.",
				"**Go Big or Go Home:** When you must **use magic** as a requirement for Big Magic, take +1 ongoing to those **use magic** rolls.",
				"**Not My Fault:** +1 to **act under pressure** when you are dealing with the consequences of your own spellcasting.",
				"**Practitioner:** Choose two effects available to you under use magic. Take +1 to use magic whenever you choose one of those effects.",
				"**Shield Spell:** When you **protect someone**, gain 2-armor against any harm that is transferred to you. This doesn't stack with your other armor, if any.",
				"**Third Eye:** When you **read a bad situation**, you can **open up your third eye** for a moment to take in extra information. Take +1 hold on any result of 7 or more, plus you can see invisible things. On a miss, you may still get 1 hold, but you're exposed to super-natural danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!"
