On a 7-9 you know the only person who can do it, but there’s a complication. Pick one: you owe them; they screwed you over; you screwed them over. On a miss, the only person who can help is someone who abso-lutely hates you.",

On a 7-9 you tripped up a couple of times, maybe someone will notice. You may also **manipulate people** with fortune telling. When you do that, ask \"What are they hoping for right now?\" as a free question (even on a miss).",

The imp must be summoned with the **use magic** move)",
				"**Crew:** You have a regular crew, a team of three or four people who will help you out with pretty much anything. They count as a team (see page 119).",
				"**Deal with the Devil:** You sold your soul to the Devil. Pick one or two things you got out of the deal: wealth, fame, youth, sensual gratification, skill (add +1 to two ratings). Payment is due either when you die, in six months (if you picked two things) or otherwise in a year.",
				"**Friends on the Force:** You know a few cops who can be persuaded to look the other way, or do you a favour, for certain considerations. You can **act under pressure** to get in touch with them when you need to divert any law enforcement attention. There will be a cost, although maybe not right now.",
				"**Made:** You’re “made” in a gang. Name the gang and describe how their operations tie into your background. You can call on gang members to help you out, but they’ll expect to be paid. Your bosses will have requests for you now and again, but you’ll be paid. Minor trouble will be overlooked, but you better not screw over any other made gangsters.",
				"**Driver:** You have +1 ongoing while driving, plus you can hotwire anything (the older it is, the fewer tools you need to do it). You also own two handy, wide-ly-available vehicles (perhaps a sportscar and a van).",
				"**Home Ground:** Your crew made a point of keeping the locals happy - keeping them safe, ensuring things always went down okay. When you’re back in your old neighbourhood, you can always find people who will hide you or help you with a minor favour, no questions asked.",
				"**Notorious:** You have a reputation from your criminal past. When you **reveal who you are**, your terrifying reputation counts as a reason for people to do what you ask, for the **manipulate someone** move. Revealing your identity to someone can create other problems later, of course."
