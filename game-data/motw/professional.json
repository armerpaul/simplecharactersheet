You might get chewed out by your superiors and there'll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren't going to get any help until you sort it all out."

				"**Unfazeable:** Take +1 Cool (max +3).",
				"**Battlefield Awareness:** You always know what's happening around you, and what to watch out for. Take +1 armour (max 2-armour) on top of whatever you get from your gear.",
				"**Leave No One Behind:** In combat, when **you help someone escape**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you get them out clean. On a 7-9, you can either get them out or suffer no harm, you choose. On a miss, you fail to get them out and you've attracted hostile attention.",

				"**Medic:** You have a full first aid kit, and the training to heal people. **When you do first aid**, roll +Cool. On a 10+ the patient is stabilized and healed of 2 harm. On a 7-9 choose one: heal 2 harm or stabilize the injury. On a miss, you cause an extra 1 harm. This move takes the place of regular first aid.",
