In either case, you get to ask them one of the questions from the **investigate a mystery** move right now. On a miss, you are required to do something terrible. If you do not accomplish what they've ordered, you cannot use this move again until you have made up for your failure.",
				"**Angel Wings:** You can go instantly to anywhere you've visited before, or to a person you know well. **When you carry one or two people with you**, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you all go where you wanted. On a 7-9, you don't quite manage it. Either you are all separated, or you all appear in the wrong place.",
				"**What I Need, When I Need It:** You may store any small object you own, putting it into a magical space nobody can get to. You may retrieve anything you stored at any time; it appears in your hand.",
				"**Smite:** Your body and divine weapon always count as a weakness against the monsters you fight. Your unarmed attacks are 2-harm intimate hand messy.",
				"**Soothe:** **When you talk to someone for a few seconds in a quiet voice**, you can calm them down, blocking any panic, anger, or other negative emo-tions they have. This works even if the thing that freaked them out is still present, as long as your voice can be heard.",
				"**Lay On Hands:** Your touch can heal injury and disease. When you **lay your hands** on someone hurt, roll +Cool. On a 10+, heal 2 harm or an illness, plus they're stabilized. On a 7-9, you can heal the harm or illness as on a 10+, but you take it into your-self. On a miss, your aura causes them extra harm.",
				"**Cast Out Evil:** You may **banish an unnatural creature from your presence**. Roll +Tough. On a 10+ it is banished. On a 7-9 it takes a little while for the banishing to take effect—the creature has time to make one or two actions. Either way, the banished creature is unharmed, and you have no control over where it goes. This move may be used on unnatural hunters (e.g. the Monstrous). On a miss, something is keeping it here. That's bad"
